#
# The logs of the sanitizer record NAME, kept as the Papers repo's rule D5 asks: in
# $RECORDS_LOGS/NAME/ (default ~/lab/records-logs, never /tmp), packed into
# $RECORDS_LOGS/NAME.tar.gz, whose sha256 goes to NAME.tar.gz.sha256 and into the record.
#
#   check  refuses (exit 2) if NAME's directory or archive exists: record logs are never
#          overwritten, so a record is never made again in silence over an earlier one.
#   pack   copies each SRC file or directory into NAME/ (none: the directory already holds the
#          logs), writes NAME/SHA256SUMS (every file in it), packs NAME/ into NAME.tar.gz, writes
#          NAME.tar.gz.sha256, and prints the archive's path and sha256 on one line.
# Used by bench/sanitize_regexmatcher.sh, bench/sanitize_rbench.sh and t1/sanitize_h6.sh.
